# QuotaTourney mod

Adds 2 commands `seed (number)` and `freq (string)` to define a replayable set of moons, seeds and weathers for different players to experience the same challenges and compare their scores.

Seed can only be set at the start of the quota to ensure both parties experience the same set of moons and weathers (reroutes automatically after each day). Freq (frequency) diticates if the moon changes every day or every quota.

After setting seed players are give a random amount of credits between 900 and 1500 to spend on equipment however they like, items bought before the first day will spawn in ship instead of coming down in the dropship.

Sales are always rolled before each day and sale rate increases as the deadline gets closer.

[AlwaysPickup](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/NutNutty/AlwaysPickup/) is recommended for the ability to pick up equipment before landing for the first time.

Last day of quota has challenge moon modifiers to make sure there are no ties!
